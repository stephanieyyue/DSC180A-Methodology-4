## Questions

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I think that the most interesting topic in my domain this quarter was exploring the use of ontologies in neuro-symbolic AI for different biomedical reasoning to improve semantic understanding across scientific data.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my quarter 2 project is to potentially develop a model using ontology embeddings to predict different associations or off target effects of compounds for drug disease mapping.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I would use a smaller but potentially better quality dataset first to make debugging and testing faster, instead of immediately working with a full PubMed dataset or a dataset that is bigger.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’m interested in exploring different knowledge graphs and different way AI models can be created with ontologies to improve mapping between biomedical datasets.
